# Grupp-13
Introduction:
Our project was to develop a robot can sort different object to specific locations that is given by its user,
this can be easily done by our UI.

Getting started:
The imports and dependencies are writen at the top of the Main.py file, and it requires Ev3 and Time python libraries.
The code is made for the lego mindstorm "Robot arm H25" model as well as the ev3 module.

Building and running:
The program needs you to input the correct current time in the time_script file, witch is calibrated by the user.
This only needs to be once per robot.
The UI will give instructions on how to maneuver the robot throughout the different phases.

Features:
